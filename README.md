# Odins Cloud

This code is useful if you have no other tools on your machine than bash.  
But that is usually not the case and there are much better tools provided by Amazon to interact with S3

The reason to write these tools is so I can prototype and quickly verify that I am doing things correctly before implementing them in C++. This is mainly necessary because the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html) these scripts are based on are relatively bad and confusing.

Please feel free to use them.
